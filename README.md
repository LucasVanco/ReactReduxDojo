# React Redux Dojo

## First Step (on paper) :

- Define the differents action you'll need to add or delete an user
- Establish the inital state of the application

## Second Step (time to code) :

- Add the actions in the file `actions/index.js`
- Create the user reducer (`user.js`) in the folder `reducers`.

> Don't touch at the other files, don't even look at them, it is for a further dojo ;)
